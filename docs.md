**GrigoriBot Docs**

If you are using GrigoriBot, you may be curious about its features. Below is a list of its commands and their syntaxes.


*Public IRC Commands*

`!help` will make the bot reply with a link to this page.

`!source` will cause the bot to reply with a link to its source.


*Admin-Only IRC Commands*

`!sort [directory]` will, in short, transfer the file found in the provided directory to the correct location. In other words, it scans the given directory for information resembling a known TV show. If it is successful, it copies/extracts the file to the correct folder. If it not, it looks for clues that the given directory contains a movie. If it does, it does the same process, but to the Movies directory.

`!shutdown` will cuase the bot to cease all functions and kill all opened screens.


*Discord Commands*

`!source` will, like before, cause the bot to reply with a link to its source.

`!release` will scan through the Discord Transition File and print each line into the channel.
